# nand2tetris
This repository includes the open source code provided for the nand2tetris course. Under projects include the source code that I will write/wrote while following this course. 

I could just include the project folder instead of all the tools as they are provided freely. However, I created this repository for easy access to the course files for when I change computers (etc).

Under `projects/`, I have included a `test.go` to compare the `.out` file with the `.cmp` file provided.

```
// go to the projects directory
go run test.go 01/Mux8Way16
// output:
// opening files: 01/Mux8Way16.out, 01/Mux8Way16.cmp
// 01/Mux8Way16.hdl implemented correctly
```

# nand2tetris
This repository includes the open source code provided for the nand2tetris course. Under projects include the source code that I will write/wrote while following this course. 

I could just include the project folder instead of all the tools as they are provided freely. However, I created this repository for easy access to the course files for when I change computers (etc).
